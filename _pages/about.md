Hello, welcome to my website! I am currently an ML Researcher/Engineer at Apple, working on algorithm development for iPhone cameras.

I recently completed my PhD at the University of Cambridge, where I worked on ML-based appearance editing and modeling. I also hold an MSc in Signal Processing and Communications from the University of Edinburgh and a BSc in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Boğaziçi University.

During my studies, I interned at Amazon as an Applied Scientist, working on generative models for a conditional image generation task. My work contributed to exploratory research efforts and offered practical solutions to a real-world problem.

Outside of work, I actively volunteer for Women in CS initiatives and enjoy photography, swimming, and running.

My research interests include generative models for computer vision, inverse rendering, and appearance representations.

I’m always happy to discuss shared research interests or ideas. Feel free to reach out!
