Hello, welcome to my website! I am currently an ML Researcher/Engineer at Apple, working on camera algorithm development for iPhones.
Prior to that, I was a PhD student at University of Cambridge, working on ML-based appearance editing and modelling.
My experience in the computer vision/graphics field includes conditional image generation/translation with diffusion and GANs, 
appearance modelling with generalizable neural fields, MLP and CNN-based image-to-image translation and classification. 

I hold an MSc in signal processing and communications from the University of Edinburgh and a BSc in electrical and electronics engineering from Bogazici University, Turkey.
In my 2nd year, I spent the summer interning at Amazon as an applied scientist. 

In my spare time, I actively volunteer for Women@CL events, enjoy photography and swimming.
