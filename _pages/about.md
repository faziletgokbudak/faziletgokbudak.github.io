Hello, welcome to my website! 

I am currently working on algorithm development for iPhone cameras 📸. Earlier, I studied a PhD in Computer Science at the University of Cambridge and had the chance to work on ML-based appearance editing and modeling. My earlier education path and other details can be found on CV section.

[comment]: <> (During my studies, I interned at Amazon as an Applied Scientist, working on generative models for a conditional image generation task. My work contributed to exploratory research efforts and offered practical solutions to a real-world problem.)

My experience and interests involve generative models, including diffusion models and transformers, neural implicit representations, and appearance modelling. I have recently developed interest in physics-based world/video models with the thought that appearance can be more accurately modelled/controlled through scene understanding.

Outside of work, I volunteer with Women in CS initiatives, enjoy photography, running, and swimming.

Happy to discuss shared research interests and ideas. Feel free to reach out!
