Hello, welcome to my website! I am a computer science PhD student working on computer vision/graphics problems. 
My research focuses on generalizable ML approaches for appearance manipulations. 
My experience in the field includes but not limited to conditional image generation (my current project, Amazon internship),
neural implicit representations (HyperBRDF), image-to-image translation (Photo retouching), and classification (Blackgrass). 

I hold an MSc in signal processing and communications from the University of Edinburgh and a BSc in electrical and electronics engineering from Bogazici University, Turkey.
In my 2nd year, I spent the summer interning at Amazon as an applied scientist. 

In my spare time, I actively volunteer for Women@CL events, enjoy photography and swimming.

I am currently writing up my thesis and also looking for exciting opportunities outside academia.
If you have something to discuss, please feel free to reach out to me via email!
