Hello, welcome to my website! I am currently an ML Researcher/Engineer at Apple, working on algorithm development for iPhone cameras.
Prior to that, I was a PhD student at University of Cambridge, working on ML-based appearance editing and modelling.

I hold an MSc in signal processing and communications from the University of Edinburgh and a BSc in electrical and electronics engineering from Bogazici University, Turkey.
In my 2nd year, I spent the summer interning at Amazon as an applied scientist. 

In my spare time, I actively volunteer for Women in CS initiatives, enjoy photography, swimming, and running.

My current research interests include generative models for computer vision, inverse rendering and appearance representations. Please feel free to contact if you would like to discuss any ideas!
