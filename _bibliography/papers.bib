abstract = {As the burden of herbicide resistance grows and the environmental repercussions of excessive herbicide use become clear, new ways of managing weed populations are needed. This is particularly true for cereal crops, like wheat and barley, that are staple food crops and occupy a globally significant portion of agricultural land. Even small improvements in weed management practices across these major food crops worldwide would yield considerable benefits for both the environment and global food security. Blackgrass is a major grass weed which causes particular problems in cereal crops in north-west Europe, a major cereal production area, because it has high levels of herbicide resistance. Moreover, detecting blackgrass in grass crops is challenging due to its visual similarity to these crops. Despite this, a systematic review of the literature on weed recognition in wheat and barley, included in this study, highlights that blackgrass – and grass weeds more broadly – have received less research attention compared to certain broadleaf weeds. With the use of machine vision and multispectral imaging, we investigate the effectiveness of state-of-the-art methods to identify blackgrass in wheat and barley crops. As part of this work, we present the Eastern England Blackgrass Dataset, a large dataset with which we evaluate several key aspects of blackgrass weed recognition. Firstly, we determine the performance of different CNN and transformer-based architectures on images from unseen fields. Secondly, we demonstrate the role that different spectral bands have on the performance of weed classification. Lastly, we evaluate the role of dataset size in classification performance for each of the models trialled. All models tested achieved an accuracy greater than 80%. Our best model achieved 89.6% and that only half the training data was required to achieve this performance. Our dataset is available at: https://lcas.lincoln.ac.uk/wp/research/data-sets-software/eastern-england-blackgrass-dataset/.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a technique to estimate measured BRDFs from a sparse set of samples. Our approach offers accurate BRDF reconstructions that are generalizable to new materials. This opens the door to BDRF reconstructions from a variety of data sources. The success of our approach relies on the ability of hypernetworks to generate a robust representation of BRDFs and a set encoder that allows us to feed inputs of different sizes to the architecture. The set encoder and the hypernetwork also enable the compression of densely sampled BRDFs. We evaluate our technique both qualitatively and quantitatively on the well-known MERL dataset of 100 isotropic materials. Our approach accurately 1) estimates the BRDFs of unseen materials even for an extremely sparse sampling, 2) compresses the measured BRDFs into very small embeddings, e.g., 7D.},

abstract = {Photo retouching is a difficult task for novice users as it requires expert knowledge and advanced tools. Photographers often spend a great deal of time generating high-quality retouched photos with intricate details. In this paper, we introduce a one-shot learning based technique to automatically retouch details of an input image based on just a single pair of before and after example images. Our approach provides accurate and generalizable detail edit transfer to new images. We achieve these by proposing a new representation for image to image maps. Specifically, we propose neural field based transformation blending in the patch space for defining patch to patch transformations for each frequency band. This parametrization of the map with anchor transformations and associated weights, and spatio-spectral localized patches, allows us to capture details well while staying generalizable. We evaluate our technique both on known ground truth filters and artist retouching edits. Our method accurately transfers complex detail retouching edits.},
